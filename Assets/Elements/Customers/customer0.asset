  talkOptions:
  - Where are you from?
  - How do you feel about the church?
  - What's your plan for the day?
  - Any news you've heard recently?
  branchChoices:
  - Yeah, it's a great place!
  - It's okay... lots of problems though.
  - Besides the monsters, I guess so.
  - To be honest, I hadn't heard of them before now.
  - They seem great! Really powerful too.
  - That sounds scary...
  - Keep the pressure up by always attacking when you have the chance.
  - Make good use of skills to keep your enemy guessing!
  - If you can, act to secure your advantage before the fight starts.
  - Not much, I still have a lot to learn.
  - I've been to quite a few places, so I would say I know a thing or two.
  - How much you know isn't important, but how you interpret that knowledge is.
  dialogue:
  - Nice to meet you, I'm Jack! Would I be able to buy that iron sword there?
  - Born and raised right here in Bloom, actually!
  - It's always so peaceful here, I really like it.
  - You're from a nearby town, right? Do you like it there?
  - 
  - That's great to hear! It sounds like a wonderful place.
  - I hope I can travel there someday!
  - 
  - Oh... Sorry to hear that. I hope it gets better over there.
  - I wonder if there's anything I could do to help...
  - 
  - Monsters? Wow, I wasn't expecting that.
  - Can't say that I've ever seen a real monster...
  - I hope it stays that way, haha!
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - I think it's great! They help so many people.
  - In fact, I want to become a part of it someday.
  - Actually, the reason I want the iron sword is so I can do better on the sentinel
    exam...
  - They don't allow us to use potions during it, but I imagine having a better sword
    would definitely help.
  - How do you feel about the sentinels?
  - 
  - Oh, really? I assumed everyone knew.
  - They're a faction of the church that specializes in combat.
  - Sentinels travel the world and save people from monsters.
  - I want to be a part of their group someday!
  - 
  - Right?! They're amazing!
  - It's always great to find people who like them.
  - It only makes me want to join their group more...
  - 
  - Er, I guess it could be seen as scary...
  - They are pretty strong after all.
  - I think it depends on how they use that power, and it seems to me that they only
    use it for good.
  - I understand your point, though.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - To be honest, all I've been thinking about is the sentinel exam later today.
  - Supposedly, they watch you as you spar with one of their own...
  - Scary, right? It's gonna be exciting though!
  - Any advice for combat?
  - 
  - That's a good idea! I shouldn't give my opponent a chance to rest.
  - I like your style.
  - Maybe you could try out to be a sentinel too? We could be partners!
  - Just kidding... Sorta.
  - 
  - A good idea for sure...
  - Unfortunately, I don't know any skills.
  - I hope that won't be a problem...
  - 
  - Huh... I suppose that's a good strategy.
  - Something along the lines of never taking a fair fight, yeah?
  - I've heard that mantra before. Not really my style though...
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - News? I've got nothing, to be honest.
  - I'm not really in the know around here though, even though I live here.
  - Funny how that works!
  - I feel like I should take this opportunity to ask you something...
  - How much would you say you know about the world?
  - I'm curious to hear your perspective as a merchant.
  - 
  - I appreciate your honesty.
  - Being open about not knowing as much as you'd like is very respectable.
  - 
  - That's great! I hope to travel even half as much someday.
  - Maybe I can once I'm a part of the sentinels...
  - If I get in, that is. Haha...
  - 
  - That's... more profound than I was expecting.
  - It also didn't really answer my question, but I suppose that will remain a mystery!
  - I like that idea. If you mold everything you learn to fit with what you already
    believe...
  - In a way, that's likely invalidating the knowledge.

  buyDialogue:
  - So, can I get that sword?
  - Where's the sword?
  - I don't want all that.
  - How much is it?
  - Sold!
  - Whoa, that's way too much!
  - 'How about '
  - Works for me!
  - Hmm... fine.
  - Sorry... I can't do that.
  - But why would I need extra potions?
  - The church will see you as well-prepared.
  - Your healers might need healing too.
  - You never know when you might want extra.
  - The church doesn't let us bring potions to the exam...
  - That... is very true.
  - That could be, but... I don't need it right now.
  - Sorry, I just want the sword.
  - Sure, why not. Throw in the potions too!
