  talkOptions:
  - Tell me about yourself.
  - Where are you from?
  - What made you join the sentinels?
  - Who else do you know in the sentinels?
  branchChoices:
  - What kind of axe do you use?
  - Why axes?
  - What do you like to craft?
  - I'd love to!
  - When were you home last?
  - It would be good if I brought some of the resources around here, right?
  - That's great! I bet you've helped out a lot of people.
  - It seems like you've met a lot of great people in the sentinels too.
  - Have you seen anything suspicious from the church since you joined?
  - What's her role in the sentinels?
  - Anything I should know about her?
  - Why is she scary?
  dialogue:
  - You're the merchant, right? Jack told us sentinels about you.
  - The name's Leon.
  - I've been with the sentinels for a couple years now.
  - I use axes in combat, which led to me getting interested in woodcutting as well.
  - Craftsmanship came from that too!
  - 
  - Usually iron. However...
  - The one I've been using for a while just broke the other day!
  - So right now I'm using a bronze one.
  - I was actually hoping you could sell me that iron one of yours...
  - 
  - Hard to say for sure.
  - I've always been on the stronger side, so I guess I figured I'd make use of that!
  - The big, sweeping swings also feel satisfying.
  - 
  - I enjoy working with weapons and shields...
  - Though I have to do that pretty often for the sentinels, meaning it feels more
    like work now.
  - So I'd say what I like crafting the most are smaller wooden sculptures.
  - Thanks for asking!
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - I'm from Scorva. Not sure if you've heard of it.
  - Big, hot desert country in the east.
  - It's a great place -- you should come visit sometime!
  - 
  - Good to hear.
  - I think we sentinels will be going in a few months...
  - Maybe you could stop by then!
  - 
  - Hmm...
  - Honestly, it's been quite a while.
  - Don't think I've been after I joined the sentinels, actually.
  - I'll be going back soon though, so I can hold out!
  - 
  - Ah, so you have heard about Scorva before! Haha.
  - You're right. Trees and water sources and things like that... are pretty scarce
    over there.
  - So anything you could bring would be good for the people there...
  - You could probably make a lot of sales!
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - To be honest..
  - I joined after the sentinels helped out my hometown.
  - They don't come out to Scorva very often, so it was really nice of them.
  - A similar thing was happening to the monsters out there... More aggressive and
    the like.
  - They helped us out, so I joined them! Simple as that really.
  - 
  - I'd like to think so!
  - Monsters all over the world have been acting differently...
  - No idea what's up with that, but we do our best to stop them from hurting people.
  - I think that's a great thing.
  - 
  - I agree!
  - I'm really lucky, honestly.
  - I didn't have many friends before I joined, so the sentinels have been...
  - Well, a godsend!
  - 
  - Er... Suspicious?
  - I don't think so...
  - I've only ever seen good deeds from them.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Besides Jack...
  - My best friend in the sentinels is probably Vera.
  - She's a girl from somewhere around here.
  - A good person for sure, but a little scary at times.
  - Jack told us about you at the same time, so you might see her as well!
  - 
  - She's one of our best healers.
  - She also uses a bow as a weapon, which works well since healers aren't supposed
    to get too close to the fight.
  - To tell you the truth, though...
  - Don't tell her I said this, but she really likes fighting with lances as well.
  - Closer range combat has been an interest for her recently, and she's been getting
    good at lance skills.
  - I wish I could help her out somehow...
  - 
  - What to know about her...
  - Well, she's a healer, but she focuses more on attacking than most healers I've
    seen.
  - She mainly uses bows, but she secretly wants to switch to using lances.
  - She's gotten quite good at lance skills!
  - Although the lance she uses is pretty cheap, I don't think she would buy a better
    one for herself... She's a bit stingy, you see.
  - Hmm, maybe if I could... nah, never mind.
  - 
  - Ha! She just can get pretty serious and stubborn sometimes.
  - If I were you, I wouldn't do anything to make her angry.

  buyDialogue:
  - Say, could I get that axe you have there?
  - ...Where's the axe?
  - Just the axe, please.
  - How much do you want?
  - Thank you kindly!
  - Whoa, that's too high.
  - 'How about '
  - I'm good with that!
  - Sure, that's fine.
  - Too much, sorry.
  - Ah, an iron lance! I could get it for Vera... But would she accept it from me?
    She mostly uses bows...
  - Even if she doesn't, it's a nice gesture.
  - A new lance could be just the thing to make her officially switch!
  - If it's coming from you, there's no way she can refuse a gift.
  - True, but... That's a lot of money I'd be throwing away for a gesure.
  - That's true! And if she wants to switch over to lances fully... Then she couldn't
    really refuse.
  - I wish I could say that for sure... She could very well be too stubborn to accept
    it from anyone though.
  - Just the axe would be best, I think.
  - Sure, I'll buy the lance as well!
