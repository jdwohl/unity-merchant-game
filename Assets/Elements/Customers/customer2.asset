  talkOptions:
  - How are you doing?
  - Where are you from?
  - Know any local legends?
  - Have you seen monsters recently?
  branchChoices:
  - This year? Do you come here every year?
  - Why was it rough?
  - I'm glad you made it too.
  - Can you tell me more about Scorva?
  - That sounds nice... the church seems too influential around here.
  - A shame really, the church is great.
  - Tell me! Please!
  - Is it because of dark magic?
  - Is it because she's a kidnapper?
  - Nah, I was just curious.
  - Only a few really cute ones!
  - Actually, I asked because I heard they were more aggressive recently.
  dialogue:
  - The name's Corwin. Just here to have a look at your wares.
  - Could be better.
  - Was a rough trek to make it here this year, honestly.
  - Glad I made it though.
  - 
  - Ah, yes. Every year I come to Bloom to pick up supplies.
  - 'I''m a blacksmith, you see. '
  - These woody areas always have good materials...
  - Ones you can't get where I'm from.
  - 
  - You know, the usual woes of traveling.
  - Hard to find places to stay along the way, so you often have to set up camp.
  - Especially when you're coming all the way out here to nowhere!
  - 
  - Thanks! You're a good kid, you know that?
  - You remind me of my kid back home...
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - I'm from Scorva. Not sure if you've heard of it.
  - Lots of big cities over there, and too few supplies.
  - The church doesn't have too much influence where I'm from, so this commotion
    here is surprising to me.
  - 
  - Ah! Have you really not heard of it?
  - It's quite a powerful nation, so I would've assumed differently,
  - No shame in not knowing though!
  - Scorva is a large country to the east, made up mostly of desert.
  - That's why supplies are so hard to come by over there.
  - However, there are some really nice beaches and other incredible natural sights
    to see.
  - There's even a volcano... You should come by sometime!
  - 
  - I'm inclined to agree with you, though I don't know much about it myself.
  - Nothing against them in particular, though...
  - Any group with that much power rubs me the wrong way.
  - 
  - You think so?
  - I suppose I'll take your word for it then, given I know so little about them.
  - I admire that passion of yours. Ahaha!
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Local legends, eh...
  - Not a lot, which is surprising since I come here so often.
  - Probably the most famous one I heard is the one about the witch.
  - Now that I think about it... I probably shouldn't tell you that one.
  - It might scare you.
  - 
  - Ha! You really wanna know that bad?
  - I respect your bravery and enthusiasm. So about this witch...
  - Supposedly, she uses magic to trick children, then steals them away from their
    homes.
  - Scary, isn't it? I know it is for me...
  - To tell you a secret, that story is the reason why I don't bring my kid when
    I come here.
  - Maybe I'm a wimp, but... better to be safe.
  - 
  - No, though she does have that.
  - Among her spells is the power to shapeshift, or so the legends go.
  - That's not the part that I thought would scare you though.
  - I'll keep the rest to myself!
  - 
  - Right on the money... Good intuition, kid.
  - According to the old tales, this witch uses dark magic to trick children and
    take them from their homes.
  - Scary stuff... Especially given that some children do go missing in these parts.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Monsters? A few, but not an abnormal amount.
  - There are lots along the route from my town, but those aren't too strong.
  - Why, have you seen any?
  - 
  - That's a great trait to have!
  - I hope my kid turns out to be someone like you.
  - 
  - Haha! That's great for you, kid!
  - Keep this a secret, but I think those wolves around these parts are just adorable.
  - Especially the little baby ones!
  - 
  - Really? That's interesting...
  - I wonder why. I suppose that's also why the church is here, huh?
  - Makes sense.
  - Well, I appreciate you looking out for me, kid!
  - I'll make sure to be careful on my way home.

  buyDialogue:
  - So, here's the deal...
  - I don't actually want to buy anything.
  - Shocking, I know! But I still want to make a deal with you...
  - As a blacksmith, one of my jobs is to reinforce shields with better material.
  - I have a couple iron shields with me today, but no wooden ones.
  - That's thanks to the lack of wood where I'm from.
  - But anyway, this leads me to an offer that you can't refuse!
  - I'll trade you an iron shield for that wooden one you have there.
  - I can reinforce that wooden shield to make it great for certain situations...
  - Plus, I have too many of these iron shields laying around anyway.
  - Iron is a lot more expensive than wood too, so you can sell this for a lot more
    than the wooden one!
  - So, what do you say? Seems like a good deal for both of us.
  - Sounds good! I'll trade you.
  - Sorry, but I think I should keep this wooden shield.
  - Great! Thanks, kid. Here you go.
  - That's all right, you might need it for something. No worries.
  - Nice talking to you. Have a good one!
