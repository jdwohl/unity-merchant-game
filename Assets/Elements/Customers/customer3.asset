  talkOptions:
  - What's with the armor?
  - How did the exam go?
  - What have you done so far?
  - Any plans for the day?
  branchChoices:
  - Skills? You know skills now?
  - Mmm, I still think it's more important to have higher speed.
  - I'm glad you like it, even though it looks kinda silly.
  - Sounds like you need a tactician by your side. Hmm...
  - Doesn't that seem a little suspicious to you?
  - That's great that the church could see past one poor performance.
  - Why would you need to craft your own stuff?
  - What did you try to make?
  - Who was the best at it?
  - Where will the practice be?
  - Do you think you'll see more wolves?
  - Will you be alright without me?
  dialogue:
  - Hey, it's good to see you! Did you hear? I'm a sentinel now!
  - Oh, this? All sentinels have to wear it.
  - It increases your defense, though it reduces your speed slightly.
  - I think it's a worthy trade-off, especially when you take skills into account!
  - 
  - Oh yeah! Skills training is one of the first things we worked on.
  - I don't have that many mastered yet...
  - To be honest, I only have one so far.
  - It's a good one though! Using it lowers the target's defense.
  - It only costs a bit of HP...
  - 
  - I understand that.
  - After all, high defense may not matter as much if you can defeat your enemies
    quicker.
  - Always the strategist you are!
  - 
  - Hah! I thought you might say that.
  - I guess it does look a bit goofy.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - About that...
  - Not great, haha.
  - I got kinda nervous...
  - I couldn't make decisions quick enough in the fight.
  - I guess they saw something in me though, since they still let me join!
  - 
  - Right?! I was thinking that while I was fighting.
  - Maybe I should have been focusing more on the fight at hand.
  - Anyway, I don't remember if I said this before but...
  - You should totally join the sentinels!
  - 
  - Huh? You mean like... the sentinels wanted me to join for some other reason?
  - I suppose it's possible...
  - I don't think it's true, though.
  - 
  - I agree! They're awesome like that.
  - I'm so glad I got in...
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - So far? Hmm...
  - Besides the skill training, nothing really.
  - Oh! We did practice crafting our own weapons and armor a couple days ago.
  - That was cool... I was pretty bad though.
  - 
  - We won't always have access to a cool merchant nearby, right?
  - On long journeys, it would be nice to have such a resourceful skill.
  - Or at least nice to have someone in our group who does... haha.
  - 
  - A few things, but the one I put the most effort into... was reinforcing my shield.
  - I have a wooden one, but the classic upgrade is to strengthen it with iron.
  - It was really hard, but I think I could do it if I put my mind to it!
  - 
  - The best? That would probably be Leon.
  - I told him about you, so he might come here at some point!
  - Apparently where he's from, they craft a lot of their own stuff.
  - Pretty cool...
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Oh yeah, I wanted to tell you about today!
  - Basically, we're gonna practice fighting against real monsters!
  - It'll be good for us and also good for this region.
  - I don't know if you've heard, but the monsters have been more aggressive recently..
  - So I think we'll be doing a good thing for the people here.
  - 
  - Do you wanna come watch?
  - Maybe you could help out a bit too, haha.
  - There's a cave to the west of here that's supposed to be a den for some tough
    monsters.
  - That's where we'll be going. I'm so excited to fight more monsters!
  - 
  - Ha! I had wondered about that.
  - We'll be going into a cave to the west of here, so...
  - I don't know if there will be wolves all the way in there.
  - I hope there will be some slimes though! I heard those are cute.
  - 
  - Ha! I hope so at least.
  - I'll have some friends with me, so I think we'll be able to do it together.
  - Vera especially is scarier than she looks...
  - And I think she looks pretty scary, haha.

  buyDialogue:
  - Say, that HP ring looks nice! Could I buy it?
  - Uh... where's the ring?
  - Sorry, I don't think I need that much.
  - How much do you want?
  - Deal!
  - Hey, that's a bit much...
  - 'What about '
  - That works!
  - I guess that's alright.
  - Too much...
  - I could use an iron shield, true... But why shouldn't I craft it myself?
  - It probably wouldn't be as high quality as this one!
  - You never know if you'll be able to do it.
  - Who knows, you may need it later today.
  - That's true, but... I think it would at least be good for me to keep trying.
  - Even so, I still think it's worth a shot...
  - You're right. I never know what exactly I'll need it for.
  - I'll just take the ring, thanks.
  - Sure, I'll take the shield as well!
