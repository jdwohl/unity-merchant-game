  talkOptions:
  - What brings you here today?
  - Learn any new magic?
  - What are you up to today?
  - Any tips for combat?
  branchChoices:
  - What do you need the potions for?
  - Anything else you might want?
  - Are you planning to head back home soon?
  - Is there anything that you know is holding you back?
  - What about healing magic?
  - Anything I can do to help?
  - I know one of them at least. He's nice.
  - I'd like to meet more of them as well...
  - I heard they're going to fight monsters in a cave to the west!
  - What's the most important spell you know?
  - Are there any status effects I should know about?
  - That was helpful, thanks!
  dialogue:
  - Hello again.
  - I'm here to buy some potions from you.
  - Figured it's best to be prepared!
  - Do I need a better reason to come see you? Hee hee.
  - 
  - What can I say? You can never be too prepared.
  - It's not for anything specific... Just because of the monsters around here.
  - Wouldn't want my journey home to be my last...
  - 
  - Nothing in particular!
  - Though who knows, maybe you can convince me to get something...
  - That's on you, however. Hee hee.
  - 
  - Nice guess. That's correct.
  - With the monsters being different recently...
  - I figured it would be best to have potions for instant, no MP cost healing.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Since I last saw you, well...
  - I've been trying at least.
  - My collection of tomes is now quite sizeable...
  - But I haven't made any real progress.
  - 
  - Hmm, I'm not sure.
  - Now that I'm thinking about it, I've only ever tried to teach myself.
  - Maybe a teacher would be able to help me make better progress.
  - Thanks for the idea!
  - 
  - Oh, were you asking about that originally?
  - I didn't even consider it!
  - Nah, I still know the same-old same-old.
  - If only I could do real magic... I'd love to be able to read a scroll someday.
  - 
  - That's sweet of you to say.
  - I think it's more of a personal problem though...
  - Maybe the magic I'm trying to learn is too simple for my brain to really work
    at, haha.
  - Something more mysterious and enigmatic might be more my style...
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Today? Hmm...
  - I didn't really have anything in mind.
  - Actually... The church is still around, right?
  - I'd like to see these new sentinel recruits.
  - I know my father would want to see who's taking up the mantle of the church...
  - 
  - Oh really? That's good to hear.
  - Someday I'd like to know more about him.
  - Well, if you two are friends, maybe I'll see him at your stand sometime!
  - 
  - More of them? So you know one?
  - So mysterious... You seem to really know what gets me intrigued.
  - ...Hee hee.
  - 
  - A cave to the west? That sounds exciting...
  - Maybe I'll check it out and see these new recruits for myself.
  - Thanks for telling me about it!
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - You're asking me? Someone else may be better equipped...
  - I don't know too much about actual fighting.
  - It's difficult to do lots of damage with a stave, after all!
  - Though I will say, a lot of people think it's necessary to conserve their MP
    for the possible next fight.
  - 'In reality, this is just wrong. '
  - MP regenerates when you're not fighting someone, so you should go all out with
    your spells every fight.
  - 
  - I would probably say Ward.
  - It's a spell that prevents the instant death status condition for the whole party...
  - For obvious reasons, such a spell is very nice to have.
  - 
  - Well, there's poison, paralysis, despair...
  - Instant death is probably the one you should be most concerned about though.
  - You'll pretty much need a spell like Ward in your arsenal at all times to be
    able to prevent it.
  - One cast and it protects the whole party!
  - They'll only be at 1 HP after though, so be careful.
  - 
  - No problem!
  - I'm glad to hear that I could help with something combat-related.

  buyDialogue:
  - Right, so... Can I get some potions?
  - ...Did you hear me right? I wanted potions.
  - Don't want all that.
  - What's the price?
  - Thanks!
  - Too much.
  - 'How about '
  - Sounds good.
  - That's... okay with me.
  - Ouch...
  - An unknown scroll? Sounds intriguing... But why should I invest so much into
    something that probably won't pan out?
  - You need a challenge to force yourself to really try.
  - The effort of figuring it out will be worth it.
  - Perhaps the allure of the unknown will help you learn!
  - I'm inclined to agree. Maybe I can really do it if I have to put my mind to it...
  - Maybe for a simpler spell... But it would be too much of a commitment for something
    so mysterious if I can't figure it out.
  - That may be true, but that alone doesn't convince me.
  - Just the potions, if that's alright.
  - Hey, why not. I'll buy the scroll too!
