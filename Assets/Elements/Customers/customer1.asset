  talkOptions:
  - Tell me about yourself.
  - Know of any interesting news?
  - What's your take on the church?
  - That ring... Are you a mage?
  branchChoices:
  - What's the name of your hometown? I'm curious.
  - A healer, huh? How much healing magic do you know?
  - What's your dad doing now?
  - '"Multiple reasons," you say?'
  - Monsters? I haven't heard about that.
  - You're not planning to join the sentinels, right?
  - I've heard that they help a lot of people... Is that wrong?
  - I agree with you, something feels off about them.
  - I don't know enough to say... But what do you mean by trouble?
  - I say you should go for it!
  - If I were you, I would focus on becoming the best healer you can be.
  - Back up a bit, "real magic?" I thought you were a healer.
  dialogue:
  - Hello... I'd like to buy an oak stave, if that's alright.
  - My name's Elise. There isn't too much to know about me.
  - I come from a town called...
  - Actually, it's so small that I don't think you would've heard of it.
  - I'm a healer, same as my dad.
  - He was a chuch priest.
  - Anything else you wanna know?
  - You really wanna hear it? That's sweet of you.
  - I come from Yoren Village in the south.
  - Population... 20? Something like that.
  - That look on your face... Looks like I was right about you not knowing, haha.
  - 
  - Not much, to be honest. I'm still pretty new.
  - I know Heal for obvious reasons, Ward for preventing instant death...
  - Oh, and I've been learning Rescue to bring people to safety!
  - It's pretty hard though...
  - 
  - It's a bit complicated.
  - I wish I could tell you more, but... basically, he had to leave the church.
  - Don't know where he is, either...
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Interesting news, eh? Not much...
  - I know that the church has arrived here for a couple reasons.
  - Though, you probably already knew that.
  - The monster sightings recently are scaring people too... But you probably knew
    that as well.
  - Yeah, both the sentinel scouting and the recent monsters contribute to their
    arrival.
  - Because monsters have been acting more aggressive recently for unknown reasons...
  - The church has come to take action -- specifically, the sentinels.
  - I guess they figured they might recruit some new members while they're at it...
  - 
  - You haven't? I figured someone would have mentioned it.
  - The monsters around this area are usually pretty docile...
  - But recently, they've been attacking people unprovoked.
  - A few people in my hometown were attacked...
  - It's quite abnormal, and no one knows the reason.
  - How strange...
  - 
  - Hah, good guess. You're right, I don't particularly feel like trying out.
  - There are others better suited to join the church, in my opinion.
  - Why am I here then, you ask? Hee hee... that's a secret.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - I'm... not a huge fan, to be honest.
  - In fact, I think they're a lot shadier than they seem.
  - 'Don''t wanna sound crazy here, but... '
  - Trouble always seems to arise when they travel somewhere. Here included.
  - How do you feel about them?
  - No, that's definitely true as well.
  - They do a lot of charity and have saved many lives.
  - 'I''m just... cynical and suspicious, I guess. '
  - 
  - Really? Most people just think I'm weird for thinking this.
  - I hope you're not just saying that to get on my good side.
  - It's certainly working though. In fact...
  - Actually, never mind. Maybe someday.
  - 
  - That's respectable. Basically...
  - Something that the church is apt to solve always seems to happen when they're
    in the area.
  - It happened that way in my town, at least...
  - People started getting sick suddenly, right before they arrived.
  - Of course, once they could save us, everyone became a fan if they weren't already.
  - Sounds suspicious to me...
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Oh, you noticed that? Good catch.
  - Though to be honest, it's not my ring. It was my father's.
  - It was passed down to me when I was pretty young.
  - I've always wanted to learn real magic, but... I could never get the hang of
    it.
  - I want to learn for his sake and mine, but it might take forever...
  - What do you think I should do?
  - Thanks, I appreciate that!
  - That's what my father wanted for me as well.
  - It's hard to learn on my own, though.
  - Hmm...
  - 
  - That's fair. It can be important to specialize.
  - I'm glad that you're looking out for me...
  - Some people just say what others want to hear, you know?
  - 
  - Well, it's not like healing isn't real magic.
  - However...
  - There's something different about casting a spell and setting something on fire.
  - Just an example, you know... hee hee.

  buyDialogue:
  - I'd like that oak stave, please.
  - What about the stave?
  - I'm not interested, sorry.
  - What's the price?
  - Sounds good!
  - Sorry... that's too much.
  - 'What about... '
  - I'm good with that.
  - Sure... I suppose.
  - That's too expensive...
  - I would consider getting that tome... Not convinced yet though. Would I be able
    to use it?
  - You never know until you try.
  - Definitely! I can tell you would be quick to learn this spell.
  - It would be hard, but it would be fulfilling just to try.
  - Not very convincing, to be honest. Also, I have tried.
  - It's pretty hard for me, you knowr? Don't think it would be quick.
  - Well... you've convinced me.
  - I think... I'll just take the stave.
  - I'll take the tome as well.
