  talkOptions:
  - Tell me about yourself.
  - What's your combat style?
  - Do you like being on the sentinels?
  - What magic do you know?
  branchChoices:
  - What's the name of the village?
  - What did the villagers think about you joining the sentinels?
  - Are you always so curt?
  - Did learning magic come naturally?
  - What kind of bow do you use?
  - I heard you're pretty good with lance skills. Is that true?
  - Why did you join?
  - Don't the sentinels help lots of people?
  - What would you do if you weren't a part of them?
  - What's the difference between Heal and Healara?
  - No offensive magic?
  - What about higher level healing magic?
  dialogue:
  - ...I'm Vera. I heard about you from Jack.
  - Not much to say.
  - I'm from a small village by here.
  - Nothing really of note there.
  - Joined the sentinels a few months back...
  - 
  - ...No one likes a nosy merchant.
  - I said it wasn't important.
  - 
  - They all loved the idea.
  - My parents especially wanted me to join.
  - And look at me now...
  - Haha.
  - 
  - Ha! That's a good way of putting it.
  - I'll have to use that in the future...
  - The next time Leon calls me rude, at least.
  - Thanks.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - I usually stay in the backline, attacking my enemies from afar.
  - I used to like archery as a kid... so bows came naturally.
  - Being in the back also means I'm in a good spot to heal people.
  - So... I learned healing magic.
  - 
  - I suppose. I picked it up pretty quickly.
  - Never really tried anything other than healing magic though, so who knows about
    other kinds.
  - I guess it doesn't come easily to everyone, huh?
  - 
  - Recently, I've been using a steel bow.
  - It's supposed to be stronger than iron, but it weighs you down more.
  - I can use it just fine, but...
  - To be honest, I prefer my old iron bow.
  - Unfortunately, I sold it to get a steel one...
  - 
  - '!'
  - Who told you tha-
  - Never mind. I can guess.
  - Sigh...
  - Yeah, I've been practicing them. I hope to someday be good enough to use lances
    in real combat.
  - Even though bows are nice, that would just be... really cool.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Eh, it's alright I guess.
  - Not much to complain about, but it also doesn't really do anything for me.
  - Know what I mean?
  - 
  - Back in my village, I was considered a prodigy.
  - Archery, magic... you name it, I could probably do it. In their eyes, at least.
  - To them, if I didn't join the fabled, heroic sentinels...
  - It would be a waste of talent.
  - If you couldn't tell, I don't quite share their views... But the sentinels are
    fine.
  - 
  - Yeah, they do.
  - Sometimes I just can't shake this not great feeling I have about them though...
  - It's not really founded in anything. Something just feels off.
  - 
  - Hmm... That's a good question.
  - If I had to say something now...
  - I think I would participate in combat tournaments.
  - If I learned some offensive magic to complement the healing I already know, I
    believe I could do pretty well.
  - ...That's a nice thought.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Not much.
  - Heal and Healara for restoring health...
  - And Ward for preventing instant death.
  - Don't think I need much else at this point!
  - 
  - Healara is stronger, as in it restores more health to the target.
  - It costs more MP to use though, so there are situations where Heal is better.
  - Got it? This will be on the test.
  - 
  - Nah, it doesn't really seem worth it to me.
  - I would have to use a rod instead of a bow if I wanted my magic like that to
    be powerful...
  - And I can heal just fine using a bow, so my current setup seems more worth it.
  - 
  - Anything higher level than what I can use right now would cost too much MP.
  - Maybe once I gain some more experience, that'll be worth putting time into...
  - But until then, I'm good.

  buyDialogue:
  - Could I buy that MP ring? I think it could be useful.
  - ...What about the ring?
  - ...I shouldn't.
  - What's the price?
  - Thanks.
  - ...Too expensive.
  - 'How about... '
  - Sounds good to me.
  - I suppose that works...
  - Sorry, can't do that.
  - Hmm... An iron bow might be nice, but why should I downgrade from steel?
  - Taking more actions in combat is always better.
  - The difference in power isn't great enough to justify using steel.
  - As a healer, being able to move quicker is even more important.
  - Always? No need to generalize.
  - As someone who has actually used a steel bow... The difference in power is more
    sizeable than you might think.
  - ...That's fair. Who knows when exactly my allies will need healing, after all.
  - I'll survive with just the ring, thanks.
  - Fine, I'll get the bow too.
