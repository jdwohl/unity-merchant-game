  sceneDialogue:
  - Phew...
  - We did it! We beat them!
  - It's all thanks to you...
  - I barely knew how to move for a second there, let alone how to fight!
  - But you helped me out...
  - That was awesome!
  - The iron sword helped for sure as well.
  - You really saved me today...
  - How can I repay you?
  - 
  - Oh yeah! Well...
  - I was going to ask if you wanted to join the sentinels.
  - There are non-combat roles, so you wouldn't have to do a combat exam like I will.
  - I'll let you think about it though...
  - I'm sure you have other opportunities ahead of you.
  - Give it some thought!
  - I'll come by and see you next week.
  - Hopefully I'll be a sentinel by then.
  - Thanks again!
  - 
  - Thanks!
  - Oh shoot, I should really get going now.
  - Thanks again for all your help today!
