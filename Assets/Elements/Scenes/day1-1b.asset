  sceneDialogue:
  - Ugh... stupid kids.
  - Hey, maybe instead of spending time dealing with me...
  - You should go check on your sentinel buddies who went to the cave early.
  - I think they're... struggling right now.
  - Thanks by the way, my merchant friend.
  - I wouldn't have known about their practice spot if not for you.
  - Hehehehehehe!
  - W-what did she just say?!
  - You... told that monster about where we were going to practice?
  - I can't believe this. I... I trusted you...
  - No time for this. We have to help the other sentinels.
  - ...You're right.
  - Goodbye... traitor.
  - ...
  - ......
  - Crawling back to me, huh?
  - Hee hee...
  - You look like you wanna ask me something.
  - 
  - Hmm... Should I tell you?
  - You have proven useful.
  - Let me think...
  - 
  - Heh, good guess.
  - I don't really wanna kill anyone...
  - Just wanna scare them.
  - That will be necessary to break apart the sentinels...
  - Should I let you join my cause?
  - Let me think for a moment.
