  sceneDialogue:
  - My father... was a priest for the church.
  - If I ever told you something about like that, it was the truth.
  - Not everything was...
  - I wanted you to trust me, but... I couldn't hide everything.
  - Anyway, supposedly... he discovered something.
  - Something secret about the church.
  - Something that he wasn't supposed to know.
  - He never told anyone about it, not even me.
  - And now his secret is lost forever...
  - They killed him because he knew something that they didn't want getting out.
  - I know it was the church. It can't just be a coincidence.
  - My guess is that it was the sentinels.
  - So... that's why I need revenge.
  - If I could learn the secret that my father gave his life for while I'm at it...
  - That would be real nice.
  - Any questions?
  - 
  - I can't be 100% sure.
  - But... I can sense it.
  - If he know what I was doing, he would be happy.
  - And together... we will make him proud.
  - I can sense that too.
  - 
  - Huh? No... I have no idea who that is.
  - I don't think I could ever do something like that...
  - Well, I'm glad we could clear that up.
  - Now nothing will stand in our way...
  - Hee hee.
